# TL;DR

- This so called **Natri** is just a simple Twitter clone that I made based on [Coding In Flow](https://www.youtube.com/@codinginflow)'s video, but there is a bit of adjustment just only for _Vietnamese_.
- The live website is in the description. You can try it out, althought I'm only making it for my friends.

## What can it do?

- ðŸ““ Working as a clone of Twitter, using [Supabase POSTGRESQL](https://supabase.com) and [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io) as database.

## Learn More

Btw, this is not a stable Next.js app because I'm using the @rc version, which has React 19 and Next.js 15.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying folders and it's contents. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.
